3. **Dynamic Permissions:**
    - Design a method to assign or modify permissions for roles.
    - Display permissions clearly for ease of understanding and modification.
4. **Custom API Simulation (Optional):**
    - Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
    - Simulate server responses to validate functionality.

**Technology Used**
Frontend Development:
React: For building the user interface and implementing component-based architecture.
Material-UI (MUI): For creating a responsive, clean, and interactive UI with pre-designed components.

Backend Simulation:
JSON Server: Used as a mock API to simulate server interactions for CRUD operations on users and roles.

Deployment:
Netlify: For hosting and deploying the project, providing a live URL for access.
